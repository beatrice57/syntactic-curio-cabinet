Syntactic curio cabinet
=======================

This repository contains naturally-occurring examples collected by
Beatrice Santorini over the years of various syntactic phenomena:

- African American English direct questions without inversion
- Doubly-filled Comp filter violations
- (Possibly) unexpected main clause phenomena in subordinate contexts
- (Possibly) unexpected violations of variously proposed constraints on
  wh-movement (Condition on Extraction Domains, Empty Category Principle,
  classic subjancency)
